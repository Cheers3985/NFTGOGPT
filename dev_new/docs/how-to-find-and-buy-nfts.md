If you are new to the NFT world, you will probably feel overwhelmed when going through all kinds of collections. Given that there are various channels to obtain NFT market information, you may get lost and not know where to find collections, what information or data to look into, what sources can be trusted and how to buy NFTs. Luckily, NFTGo.io is here for you! Let's dive in.

**1. Mint NFTs in the Primary Market**

Before finding any collections, you need to figure out which market you plan to invest in, either participating in the primary market through minting NFTs or trade NFTs on the secondary market. If you are a risk-taker, you can start from the primary market. There are various ways to find minting opportunities, including Twitter, alpha communities, and third-party platforms. NFTGo.io also offers a [Drops page](https://nftgo.io/nft-drops) where it lists out upcoming collections along with their social links and launch dates. To determine which collections to mint, you will need to check a few things. You can use this checklist to briefly evaluate the collection and take your next steps:
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Collection name:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Collection website:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Discord link & community size:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Twitter link & follower size:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Other social media links & follower size (if there are any):</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Doxxed team (Yes/No):</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Roadmap (Yes/No):</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1px!important;"> ☐ Utilities (e.g. exclusive community; airdrops):</p>

**2. Buy NFTs in the Secondary Market**

If you are looking for secondary market opportunities, the channels for finding good collections will be even more spread out as there are multiple marketplaces and sources. NFTGo.io provides a [Top Collections](https://nftgo.io/analytics/top-collections) page that lists out collections in one place. You will find key metrics of each collection, including floor price, market cap, trading volume, the number of whales and blue chip holders. These metrics will give you a quick snapshot of how these collections perform and you can select your favorite ones to dig further.

When it comes to analyzing a single collection, it involves various perspectives and metrics. Let's take [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://nftgo.io/collection/bored-ape-yacht-club/overview) as an example. The first thing to learn is how this collection performs in the market. For BAYC, its market cap and trading volume ranked within the top 10 collections, which means this collection is quite popular and promising in the market. Besides that, its market cap and price trends are also stable.

It is also essential to look into collection holders as they are the community that determines the value of the collection. In most cases, blue chip holders and whales are more likely to represent smart money. By looking at the blue chip potential of these metrics, you will get a clear picture of the growth potential of the collection.
