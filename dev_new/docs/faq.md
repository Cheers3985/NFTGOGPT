<h3> How do I Access Data API? </h3>

<h3> What is the NFTGo Data Source? </h3>

NFTGo uses a self-developed stable blockchain data collection engine to obtain the latest on-chain transaction data from the blockchain. This data is then parsed into readable NFT market data.

<h3> Can I Purchase NFTs on NFTGo? </h3>

Users are able to purchase NFTs straight from NFTGo. NFTGo is a trading aggregator that supports the major NFT marketplaces, including that of OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Cryptopunks.

With this function available, the user experience is optimized through improved NFT liquidity and lower gas fees. The need to transition from social media platforms (where trends are discovered), to analytics platforms (to analyze projects), and finally to marketplaces (to purchase NFTs) can be done away with when a user uses NFTGo.

<h3> Are There Any Plans for Multi-chain Deployment? </h3>

Currently, NFTGo supports the Ethereum blockchain and is looking to support more mainstream blockchains in time to come.

<h3> Why are Some Collections or NFT Assets Missing on NFTGo? </h3>

To ensure that the data provided by NFTGo truly reflects NFT market trends, and help users discover high-quality and reliable collections, a standard has been set up for NFT collections. Only collections that have surpassed the standard will be qualified to be listed on NFTGo.
