<h3> What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)? </h3>

NFTs are cryptographic assets that resides on a blockchain. These assets have unique identification codes and metadata that distinguishes each of them. As evident from the name 'Non-Fungible', there is only 1 of each NFT. NFTs are unique and irreplaceable, and they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency, unlike cryptocurrencies which are fungible.

<h3> Use Cases of NFTs </h3>

There are several use cases that could be possible for NFTs.

Physical assets like real estate and artwork can be digitally represented using NFTs. Just recently in October 2022, the <a href = "https://blog.originprotocol.com/the-first-real-estate-sale-via-nft-marketplace-executed-on-origin-protocols-story-marketplace-487127a5a77"> first real estate sale</a> via a NFT marketplace was completed. This was a NFT marketplace created by Origin Protocol for physical property exchange.

NFTs are also mediums that can remove intermediaries and connect artists with audiences. Transactions are thus simplified and artists can be rewarded for their efforts, without having to be exploited, a common occurrence within the traditional art and music industry.

NFTs are a nascent space, and have a lot more potential use cases that could arise as infrastructure in the space matures.

<h3> Current NFT Market </h3>

There has been a couple of trends within the NFT space.

<h4> 1. Collectibles </h4>

The first category of NFTs to have blown up was collectible, mainly driven by the <a href = "https://nbatopshot.com/"> NBA Top Shot</a>. This was a collection of non-fungible tokenized NBA moments, that were presented in a digital card form. This collection received significant interest from the market, especially NBA fans. The surge in interest and demand led to the price increase, with the most expensive NBA Top Shot selling for a price of $208,000.

<h4> 2. Profile Pic (PFP) </h4>

The next category of NFTs to take over the market was that of PFPs. With the 2 main collections being CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. This drove a series of PFP collections gaining attention from the market, including that of Doodles, Cool Cats and Azuki. PFPs are viewed as a digital identity people have, and thus was able to onboard large masses given the ease of understanding.

<h4> 3. Music </h4>

Given that traditional music records usually take the bulk of the profits generated, leaving the artists with pennies for their effort, the industry became very interested in music NFTs knowing that intermediaries such as records were not essential should these music be released on the blockchain. This led a series of music NFT being launched by musicians, and high key events such as <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60121538"> The Beatles being sold as a NFT</a>.

<h4> 5. Land </h4>
