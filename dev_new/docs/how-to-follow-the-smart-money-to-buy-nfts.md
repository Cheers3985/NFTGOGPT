NFT Whales are investing millions of dollars to collect NFTs. Therefore, they are considered to be the most serious players in the market. Following their activities might help you discover effective NFT investment strategies. The question is, how do you find these whales? And how can you follow their trading activities to buy NFTs? Let's dive in.

If you are not sure who the whales are, we define whales as those with wallet address that exceeds $1,000,000 in NFT collection holding value. You will find all whales in one place on [NFTGo.io Whale List](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list) (see image below). There are also some well-known influencers on this list, including [Pranksy](https://nftgo.io/account/ETH/0xd387a6e4e84a6c86bd90c158c6028a58cc8ac459/NFT) and [Dingaling](https://nftgo.io/account/ETH/0x54be3a794282c030b15e43ae2bb182e14c409c5e/NFT).

By looking at each wallet profile, you will have a general idea of the wallet performance. You will get to know their holding value, profit and loss, NFTs they have, and other info. It is up to you to pick the whales you are interested in. For example, you may prefer wallets that have positive profit and loss value, or wallets that have high holding value. If you have more than one whale on your list, you can also add them to your [watchlist](https://docs.nftgo.io/docs/watchlist) dashboard so it is easier to track things in one place.

**Note: the number of NFTs and collections owned by the address may be inconsistent with other platforms because NFTGo.io has its [listing criteria](https://docs.nftgo.io/docs/listing-criteria).*

Then, we can look into each whale and find potential collections to invest in. Let's say you find that one of your favorite whales recently bulk purchased NFTs in a collection within 24 hours. You probably need to pay more attention to this collection than others. An easy way to determine if this collection is worth investing in is to check if other whales also bought it during the same time. You can find this info under [Most Whales Involved](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/trade) (see image below). In most cases, the more whales involved, the more certain to invest. But please be aware that whales can afford losses and they can ape in more money than you do. And there are also other factors you need to consider (e.g. community size, art style, floor price, etc.).
